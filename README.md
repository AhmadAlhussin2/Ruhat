## Project descripton
Our website is for creation and conducting quizzes. It is much more easier for teachers to check students' knowledge by using quizzes, because it can reduce time for checking. Here teachers can create a quiz and then students can join this quiz, and in the end teachers will get the results of the quiz. And because most companies with such functionality left Russian market, ours will be really useful nowdays in Russia.
